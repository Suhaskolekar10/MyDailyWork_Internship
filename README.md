# MyDailyWork Internship - Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the repository of my completed tasks as a Machine Learning Intern at **MyDailyWork**. This README provides an overview of the four projects I have completed during my internship.

## Overview

During this internship, I focused on building practical machine learning solutions for various problems, including spam detection, customer churn prediction, movie genre classification, and fraud detection. Each project includes the data processing, model training, and evaluation steps, along with detailed notebooks and code files.

## 1. ðŸš€ SMS Spam Detection Model

### Description:
The goal of this project was to build a model to automatically classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam. The model uses techniques such as TF-IDF and classifiers like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression to effectively filter out spam messages.

### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing with text cleaning and tokenization.
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF.
- Model training using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
- Model evaluation with precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## 2. ðŸš€ Customer Churn Prediction Model

### Description:
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for subscription-based services. The model aims to help businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them.

### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Feature selection and engineering.
- Model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Model evaluation with AUC-ROC and accuracy metrics.

## 3. ðŸš€ Movie Genre Classification Model

### Description:
This project focuses on classifying movies into genres based on plot summaries. The model is built to enhance content recommendation systems and organize large movie datasets.

### Key Features:
- Text preprocessing, including tokenization and padding.
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings.
- Model training using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
- Model evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix.

## 4. ðŸš€ Credit Card Fraud Detection Model

### Description:
The objective of this project was to create a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time. The model helps in preventing fraudulent activities and ensuring secure transactions.

### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing with handling imbalanced data using techniques like SMOTE.
- Feature selection and scaling.
- Model training using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- Model evaluation with confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.
